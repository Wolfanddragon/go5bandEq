## go5bandEq
Simple 5 band EQ tool

Uses Butterworth filters in order to eq an input .wav file. 
GUI allows you to enter absolute paths to input and output files and modify the amplification of present five bands.

Interface is implemented for Windows, although the logic of the code is simple and can be easily ported to another platforms.
Tested poorly, do not mind the console output.
